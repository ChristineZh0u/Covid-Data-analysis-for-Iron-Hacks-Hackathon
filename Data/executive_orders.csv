Do not require a  healthcare provider’s note to validate the illness or return to work of employees who are sick  with acute respiratory illness; healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be  extremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely way.    Ensure your sick leave policies are up to date, flexible and non-punitive in order to allow  sick employees to stay home to care for themselves, children or other family members.  Consider encouraging employees to do a self-assessment each day in order to check if they  have any COVID-19 type symptoms (fever, cough or shortness of breath).    d. Separate employees who appear to have acute respiratory illness symptoms from other    employees and send them home immediately. Restrict their access to the business until  they have recovered.    .

Provide protection supplies such as soap and water, hand sanitizer,  tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for use by employees.    11    TSS SSS SS SS SSSI ESS SSSI SAI SUS ES SAIS GGUS SSSI  \x0c          EDDA DE DED A Da DEDEDE DDD ISIE    Boe    $a  oa eek  wa ; .

Code ch. 10-14~3 (the “Emergency Disaster Law”); (b) employing  any measure and giving any direction to the ISDH and local boards of health as is  reasonably necessary for securing compliance with the Emergency Disaster Law or  with the findings or recommendations of the ISDH or local boards of health because  of conditions arising from the actual or threatened emergency; and (c) controlling  ingress to and egress from a disaster area (here, the entire State of Indiana), the  movement of persons within said area, and the occupancy of premises in said area;    the ISDH, which reports to me as the Governor, also has broad legal authority and  powers in connection with public health emergencies (Ind. Code ch. 16-19-3),  including, for example, the powers to do what is reasonable and necessary for the  prevention and suppression of disease, to forbid public gatherings when necessary  to prevent and stop epidemics, to bring actions in the courts for the enforcement of  health laws, and all powers necessary to fulfill the duties prescribed by law; and    in light of the above, and after consultation with and the concurrence of the ISDH  and its Commissioner, it is necessary and proper to take further actions to protect  the health, safety and welfare of all Hoosiers in connection with the continuing and  evolving threat posed by COVID-19, as more particularly described herein,    DADA DIRDADK ADK DIK ADR IRDRDIR DEIR D EIR DA IRD IR DIK IRDA DADC DIC DEDEDE DADE DADE DR IIK DADK DADC DK DAD DADRA DRIIR DADA    Sa pecrecteceeeemeeeeperneemeenecneeneeneeerneenernerReeRe epee Ree peep peepee Tee Tee TTT  \x0c     Fa DAT ADADRDAIR DRI I EDAD ADAIR IRI DRIED ADAIR DRI IA DADA DA DRIED Ee    ER EPA EG SP oo oun a aa aL AP Ro ne    1s    NOW, THEREFORE, I, Eric J.

On March  6th, the ISDH confirmed the first case of COVID-19 and on March 16"", the ISDH  reported the first death in Indiana due to COVID-19. In the span of 30 days,  Indiana now has 4,944 confirmed cases with 139 deaths. Unfortunately, we expect  these numbers to continue and rapidly increase in the days ahead. On April 3,  2020, I extended the declaration of a public health emergency for an additional  thirty (30) days;    despite significant steps being taken in our State, this virus remains a serious threat  to the health, safety, and welfare of all residents of Indiana;    those who work as first responders and those who work in clinics, hospitals, and  care facilities are the dauntless heroes fighting this disease and are being stretched  to capacity and beyond, requiring additional steps to reinforce them;    as Governor, under Indiana’s Emergency Management and Disaster Law, Ind. Code  ch. 10-14-3 (“Emergency Disaster Law”), I have been given broad authority to take  actions necessary to prepare for and respond to the prompt and efficient rescue,  care and treatment of persons victimized or threatened by disasters, which include  an epidemic, public health emergency and any other public calamity requiring  emergency action;    as Governor, my authority and powers under the Emergency Disaster Law to  declare and respond to public health emergencies on behalf of our State,  specifically include:    > making, amending and rescinding the necessary orders, rules and regulations  to carry out the response to a disaster;    > suspending the provisions of any regulatory statute prescribing the procedures  for conduct of state business, including the orders, rules or regulations of any  state agency if strict compliance with any of these provisions would in any way  prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency; and    > allowing persons who hold a license to practice certain health care and other  professions to practice their respective professions in Indiana during the  period of the state of emergency if the state in which a person’s license or  registration was issued has a mutual aid compact for emergency management  with Indiana; and    DaDADK    RDA DA DIK DR DA DIK DADADEIICDAD KDR D RIE DEIR DADE IRD AIR DADK ADAIR DADC DEIR DA IR DRI DEICIDE IR DAIRDIK IEDR IR DEIR DA DIRIR IIR    a  \x0cFie DADA IK DA DRDK DR DAD KDR DAD AIR DADA IR DADA IRDA DADRA DEIR IRDA DRIED RECG    CE ee ee eee ee ee eee eee ere eG Pie a i Fe ie i iG PIG FG Pi 2 a Boo Ro Poo Boo Po BO Poo POO    SiCDRIKDADK IADR DADE DADA IRDA IRDA IR DK IR DR IRDA IRDA DEIR DE DADE DRDADIC    WHEREAS, _ in light of all of the above, it is necessary and proper to take further actions to    protect the health, safety and welfare of all Hoosiers in connection with the  continuing and evolving threat posed by COVID-19 and preempt the need to take  more stringent and severe actions, as more particularly described herein.    NOW, THEREFORE, I, Eric J. Holcomb, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor by the  Indiana Constitution and the laws of the State of Indiana, and for the duration of this public health  emergency, do hereby order:    1.    Home Health Orders:    Ind. Code § 16-27-1-16 is waived to allow a home health agency to accept written orders for  home health services from any licensed physician, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist  or physician assistant acting within the scope of his or her practice authorized under state    Health Care Providers Without an Active License:    Individuals who seek to provide health care in the State of Indiana in response to this public  health emergency who are not currently licensed or certified to practice in the state, either  because their Indiana license or certification is no longer active or they are licensed or certified  by another state, may obtain temporary authorization to provide health care services as  outlined below:    a. Retired and Inactive EMS Professionals. Any EMS professional (emergency medical    responder, emergency medical technician (EMT), advanced emergency medical  technician, and paramedic), whether certified or licensed in the state or not, who within  the past five (5) years has retired or surrendered his or her license or certification or  whose license or certification is otherwise inactive but whose license or certification was  not revoked, suspended or relinquished, may be authorized as follows:    i. To provide supplemental health care services in Indiana during this public health  emergency without reinstatement or approval by the Indiana EMS Commission. Ind.  Code §16-31-3-1 and Ind. Code §16-31-3-2 are suspended to the extent that a  formerly certified or licensed EMS professional may furnish or provide emergency  medical services without the requirement of a license or certification or  reinstatement but shall not be the sole patient caregiver and must be under the direct  supervision of either a certified or licensed EMS professional or a licensed healthcare  professional (such as a nurse, respiratory therapist, nurse practitioner, physician’s  assistant, or physician).    ii. To provide primary unsupervised patient care for patients as part of emergency  response, transports and facilities with a temporary certification or licensure. Ind.  Code §16-31-3-1 and Ind. Cod §16-31-3-2 are suspended to permit the Indiana  Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) to issue temporary certifications and  licensures to EMTs, Advanced EMTs and paramedics for a period not to exceed ninety  (90) days when a provider organization and the organization’s medical director have  agreed to utilize the EMS professional in their organization or facility. The provider  organization and medical director are responsible for any re-orientation or quality  assurance that is needed for the EMS professional before allowing him or her to  resume patient care responsibilities.    b. EMS Education/Waivers. Pursuant to Ind. Code §16-~31-3-5 IDHS is authorized to grant    waivers of the EMS rules established by the EMS Commission except for IDHS “may not  waive a rule that sets forth educational requirements for a person regulated” by the EMS  Commission. In order to expedite the potential influx of new EMS professionals, for  duration of the Public Health Emergency, §16-~31-~3~-5 is suspended in order to permit  IDHS to waive educational requirements as necessary.    Physician Assistant Students. To clarify the provision in 92.d. of Executive Order 20-13,  if a physician assistant student has successfully completed all required course work at an  accredited school, has applied for a license with the PLA and supplied the PLA a certificate  of completion, the provisions of Ind. Code § 25-27.5-4-1 requiring the Physician Assistant  National Certifying Examination being taken and a background check being completed  will be suspended. Any license issued under these provisions shall only be effective during  this public health emergency and further, will be initially limited to a period of 90 days  which may be renewed in 30-day increments so long as the public health emergency    2    ne    PDRDK IADR IDE DK DR DK ICDA DK DRDK IR DEIR DADK IRDA DK DAD AIR DADE IADR IIR DADE IRDA IIR DAD ADR DA IRDA DEIR DADE IRDA IR DAD EDIE    xe    Je  \x0cFO GIG Fi 2G Pas Pod ed oe PDO WG    ee Pe iG PG Pia PG IG PG iG PG PG GPa So Bac ooo Bo Do a Do Poo Poo Poo    SOIR IR DEIR DEIR DADE DADE IADR DADRA DK IRDA DADA IR DADRA IR DEIR DEDEDE         continues. Upon the lifting of this emergency, all application procedures for initial  licensure will be reinstituted and must be followed. The effective date of this specific  provision is March 30, 2020, the date of issuance of Executive Order 20-13.    . Designation of Certain Workers as Health Care Providers under FFCRA:    Congress recently enacted the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, HR 6201, effective  April 1, 2020, which, among other things, authorizes expanded paid sick and family leave for  covered employees during the COVID-19 national emergency. The Act exempts health care  providers from its provisions. While the act provides a definition of “health care provider” it  also allows a governor to expand who is a health care provider necessary for that state’s    response to COVID-19.    Solely for purposes of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, any employee of any  provider of support to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, older adults, or  individuals with mental health needs, including substance use, funded through any state or  federal program, Medicaid Home and Community Based Services, and/or provided in an  Intermediate Care Facilities (CRF/DD, CRMNF, or ICF/IDD as defined in 405 IAC 1-1-1) who  is providing care and support essential to activities of daily living and independence to a  vulnerable population of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, older adults,  or individuals with mental health needs, including substance use, is considered a health care  provider vital to Indiana’s response to COVID-19.    . Standby Guardian Designations:    The requirement in Ind. Code § 29-3-3-7(c) that appointment by a parent of a Standby  Guardian be notarized is suspended and, instead, the appointment may be witnessed by a    single person.    This Executive Order is a supplement to, deemed to be part of, Executive Orders 20-02 & 20-17.    IT IS SO ORDERED.    IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I, Eric J.

Code ch. 10-14-3; (b) suspending the provisions of any regulatory statute  prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, including the orders,  rules, or regulations of any state agency if strict compliance with any of these  provisions would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping  with the emergency; and (c) using the services and facilities of existing officers,  agencies of the state, and of political subdivisions, who shall cooperate with and  extend services and facilities to the governor as I may request; and    in light of the above, it is necessary and proper to take further actions to protect  the health, safety and welfare of all Hoosiers in connection with the continuing  and evolving threat posed by COVID-19, as more particularly described herein;    BESS SLOSS DDC DCD DDD DDD DDD ADDO    HED AD ADDR ROAD DCD DIADIR DCD DIDI DIRDIA DIA DIR DIR DIR DIR DIR DIC DIR DIC DIA DIC DIC DIC DIR DIR DIDI SIRDIR DADA DE DIR DIR DIC DIC DIR DADA DADA DIRDIADIA    a  \x0cKS    PAGE N GaP AG Pm Goo PO BD BOB A BBD PBB B DIG BD DBS DB BD BD ON Sa    ra    a    PAIR IRIAIAIADR IR DRDR IR DR DR IRDA DRIER DRIED DEDEDE DROS  ne    NOW, THEREFORE, I, Eric J.

Normal Evaluations: School corporations (as defined in Ind. Code § 20-  28-11.5-3) may conduct Evaluations for the current School Year  according to their previously adopted plans, except that objective  measures of student achievement and growth on the statewide and local  assessments that were not completed in advance of the last day of in-  person instruction, and in-person observations that were not conducted  in advance of the last day of in-person instruction, shall not be considered.

This restriction extends to the  Indiana Government Center, Indianapolis office locations, and other offices  throughout our State;    on March 31, 2020, by Executive Order 20-14, I extended Executive Orders  20-04, 20-10 & 20-11 which, among other things, prohibited restaurants,  bars, nightclubs and other establishments from providing in-dining services  and established compliance and enforcement actions to be taken by ISDH and  the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission (ATC) for dining establishments  failing to prohibit in-person dining;    on April 6, 2020, I issued Executive Order 20-18 which modified and extended  the original stay-at-home order of March 23, 2020 (Executive Order 20-08);    as of the date of this Executive Order, the virus has now spread to every county in  Indiana. On March 6"", the ISDH confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in Indiana  and, on March 16*, the ISDH reported the first death in our State due to COVID-  19.

This restriction extends to the  Indiana Government Center, Indianapolis office locations, and other offices  throughout our State and this directive has been extended or modified by  Executive Orders 20-18, 20-22, 20-26 & 20-28; and    > Lissued Executive Orders 20-04, 20-10, 20-11, 20-14, 20-18, & 20-22 which,  among other things, initially prohibited restaurants, bars, nightclubs and other  establishments from providing in-dining services and established compliance  and enforcement actions to be taken against dining establishments failing to    prohibit in-person dining;    following the stay-at-home order, we began to plan to reopen our Hoosier economy  while prioritizing Hoosiers’ health by continuing to work with experts utilizing a  data-driven approach to make decisions based on facts, science, and  recommendations from experts in health care, business, labor, and education in    reopening our economy;    to continue mitigation of COVID-19 and to lower the risk of a resurgence, a  measured and staggered approach to reopening businesses and entities has been  instituted. Five stages have been outlined with each ensuing stage being subject to  fewer restrictions and limitations than the previous stage,    Stage 1 began with the stay-at-home directive issued on March 23, 2020, and  continued until May 4, 2020 when Stage 2 commenced,    Stage 2 began the reopening of Indiana on May 4, 2020, and continued until May  22, 2020 when Stage 3 commenced;    Stage 3 continued the reopening of Indiana on May 22, 2020, and was scheduled  to expire on June 14, 2020;    as the impact of COVID-19 for each county has varied, the impact in each county  will be continually assessed to determine which stage applies to a particular county  at the end of each time period. If the impact of COVID-19 is minimal or has  significantly lessened, the county may be permitted to advance to the next stage.  However, if the impact of COVID-19 has increased or failed to lessen, the county  may be required to stay at the current stage or return toa prior stage;    for a county to advance to the next stage or be required to stay at a current stage  or return to a prior stage, the following factors will be considered: i) the number  of hospitalized COVID-19 patients; 11) the capacity for critical care beds and  ventilators; iii) the ability to test for COVID-19; and iv) the capacity for contact    tracing;    since the reopening of Indiana began on May 4, 2020, the number of hospitalized  COVID-19 patients has decreased and continues to decrease; our capacity for  critical care beds and ventilators is stable; our testing for COVID~-19 is increasing;  and our ability to contact trace is available and ongoing in all 92 counties; and    based on all of the above, Indiana may move into Stage 4 to further reopen our  Hoosier economy while continuing to take measures to protect Hoosiers from the  spread of this dangerous virus.

Five stages were outlined with each ensuing stage being  subject to fewer restrictions and limitations than the previous stage, as  follows:    > Stage 1 began with the stay-at-home directive issued on March 23, 2020,  and continued until May 4, 2020 when Stage 2 commenced,    > Stage 2 began the reopening of Indiana on May 4, 2020, and continued  until May 22, 2020 when Stage 3 commenced,    > Stage 3 continued the reopening of Indiana on May 22, 2020, and  continued until June 12, 2020, when Stage 4 commenced,    > Stage 4 further expanded the reopening of Indiana, beginning on June  12, 2020, and is scheduled to expire at 11:59 on July 3, 2020; and    > Subject to continuing improvement, Stage 5 was scheduled to begin at  12:01 a.m. on July 4, 2020;    as the impact of COVID-19 for each county has varied, the impact in each  county will be continually assessed to determine which stage applies to a  particular county at the end of each time period.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, Eric J. Holcomb, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor by the  Indiana Constitution and the laws of the State of Indiana, do hereby order:    1. Face Covering Requirement:    This directive becomes effective at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, July 27, 2020, and continues  for a period of thirty (30) days until 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, August 26, 2020, unless  rescinded, modified or extended by me. Any recission, modification or extension of this  directive will be contingent on the status of our state’s COVID-19 data which may be  directly impacted and influenced by Hoosiers’ compliance with this directive. During this  time period, every individual within the State of Indiana shall wear a face covering over  the nose and mouth when:    a. inside a business, public building, or other indoor place open to the public. This  does not extend, however, to private offices, private workspaces or meetings in  which six feet of social distancing can be achieved and maintained between people  not in the same household;    b. in an outdoor public space wherever it is not feasible to maintain six feet of social  distancing from another person not in the same household; or    c. using public transportation or while in a taxi, private car service, or ride-sharing  vehicle;    unless an exemption outlined in § 4 below applies or when in a private residence.    . Prior Executive Orders on Face Coverings:    This Executive Order does not supersede or modify any prior directives requiring  employees and staff at restaurants, bars, taverns, wineries, breweries, gyms, exercise and  fitness centers and personal service businesses to wear face coverings. These directives  extend for the duration of the public health emergency unless specifically rescinded.    . Definitions:    a. Face Coverings: A “face covering"" means a cloth which covers the nose and mouth  and is secured to the head with ties, straps, or loops over the ears or is simply  wrapped around the lower face.    b. Face Shields: A “face shield” is a mask, typically made of clear plastic, which covers  the nose and mouth.    . Exemptions to Wearing Face Coverings:    The following people are exempt from this directive to wear a face covering but are  strongly encouraged to do so if practicable and without undue risk, or alternatively, are  strongly encouraged to wear a face shield:    2    SY ELE EE NEUE UE TX TE    SCBA DADRA DADA DR DADA DR DADA IRDA DADRA DADA IRDA DK IRDA DA DK DR DADA IIR DDR DK DK DDR IK DR DAD K IR DR DR IK DDK DK DR DDRII    J  \x0cseta diatiata tia aint attaitiatiaitaaaaate    FAP Pe ee a Pa eG Oo BGG Po DGG Ta Pa PG BG GG eS    a    . children under two (2) years of age should not wear a face covering because of the    risk of suffocation;    . children who are over the age of two (2) years and under the age of eight (8) years    unless otherwise required by a directive in this Executive Order;    any person with a medical condition, mental health condition or disability which  prevents wearing a face covering;    . any person who is deaf or hard of hearing, or communicating with a person who    is deaf or hard of hearing, where the ability to see the mouth is essential for  communication;    any person for whom wearing a face covering would create a risk to the person  related to their work, as determined by local, state, or federal regulators or  workplace safety guidelines;    any person while consuming food or drink, or is seated at a restaurant or other  retail food establishment to eat or drink,    . any person while exercising or engaging in sports activity and who can maintain    six feet of social distancing from other people not in the same household;    . any person who is in a swimming pool, lake, or similar body of water and who can    maintain six feet of social distancing from another person not in the same  household;    any person while driving alone or with passengers who are part of the same  household as the driver;    any person obtaining a service which requires temporary removal of the face  covering for security surveillance, screening, or a need for specific access to the  face, such as while visiting a bank or while obtaining a health-related or personal  care service involving the face, however the removal of the face covering must be  temporary and limited only to the extent necessary to obtain the service;    . any person, upon request, as part of a law enforcement investigatory stop or    investigation or court-related proceeding;    any person who is incarcerated;    . any person who is experiencing homelessness;    . any person while giving a speech for a broadcast or to an audience if the person    can maintain six feet of social distancing from another person not in the same  household; or    . any person attending or engaged in a religious service as he or she must already    maintain six feet of social distancing from another person not in the same  household.    5. Compliance:    The purpose of the requirement in this Executive Order is to protect the health and lives  of Hoosiers, to ensure businesses will remain open, to allow schools to reopen and operate  safely, and to allow Hoosiers to continue to participate in their chosen activities. State and  local health departments shall be responsible for enforcing compliance through education  about the importance of wearing face coverings and dispelling myths and misconceptions  about the use and/or the benefits of the requirement. If the applicable data on the virus  does not improve or continues to worsen in our State, there may be little choice but to  reverse course and return to a prior stage in our reopening plan for Indiana.

Five stages were outlined initially with each ensuing stage being subject  to fewer restrictions and limitations than the previous stage, as follows:    > Stage 1 began with the stay-at-home directive issued on March 23, 2020, and  continued until May 4, 2020 when Stage 2 commenced;    > Stage 2 began the reopening of Indiana on May 4, 2020, and continued until  May 22, 2020 when Stage 3 commenced;    > Stage 3 expanded the reopening of Indiana on May 22, 2020, and continued  until June 12, 2020, when Stage 4 commenced; and    > Stage 4 further expanded the reopening of Indiana, beginning on June 12,  2020, and was scheduled to expire at 11:59 on July 3, 2020;    Stage 5 was projected to begin on July 4, 2020, and while certain indicators of  COVID-19 mitigation were trending well, a key indicator, the percentage of  positive cases compared to the number of tests performed, was increasing and thus,  warranted additional monitoring and measures before a significant lessening of  further restrictions could occur;    additionally throughout many areas across the United States, there were signs of  increased coronavirus spread and evidence of resurgence in areas where there has  been significant reopening of businesses and easing or disregard of mitigation  efforts;    in response to these developments, Stage 4.5 was created and began on July 2,  2020, which paused the expansion of the reopening of Indiana and Stage 4.5 has  remained in place since July 2""4;    in addition to pausing at Stage 4.5, on July 24, 2020, a face covering requirement  was instituted to mitigate and slow the spread of this disease in the Hoosier state;    pausing at Stage 4.5, imposing a face covering requirement, and the collective  efforts of Hoosiers have proven effective in slowing the spread of this disease in the  Hoosier state, as demonstrated by the following:    > the rate of COVID-19 positivity has continued to decline from a high of nearly  17% in late April to 3.9% over the most recent 7-day average;    > the number of new cases per 100,000 people has been steady or declining in  most counties in the state;    > while COVID-19 deaths tragically continue, we have seen a significant decline  in the number of Hoosier deaths per week since the height of the pandemic;    > hospitalization rates have also held steady during this same time period, but  they remain more than 30% higher than the state’s low of 600 in June; and    > our capacity for critical care beds and ventilators, the ability to test for COVID-  19 and the capacity for contact tracing remain more than adequate; and    based on all of the above, the State of Indiana may move into Stage 5 which will  allow all businesses to reopen and operate while continuing to require a few  strategic and critical measures to protect Hoosiers from the spread of this  dangerous virus.

Stage 5: The New Normal During a Global Pandemic    On September 26, 2020, at 12:01 a.m. all individuals, businesses, entities and counties in  the State will be permitted to transition into Stage 5 and at such time must adhere to the  directives in this Executive Order. Stage 5 will continue until 11:59 p.m. Saturday,  October 17, 2020, unless extended, modified or rescinded by me.    The directives in prior Executive Orders pertaining to the Stay At Home Order (Stage 1),  Stage 2, Stage 3, Stage 4, Stage 4.5, and pertaining to face coverings are rescinded and  superseded by this Executive Order (Executive Orders 20-08, -09, ~18, ~22, -26, -28,  -29, -32, -35, ~36, ~37, -39 & -42.    The implementation of Stage 5 brings Indiana to a new normal.    To allow our economy to remain fully reopen and protect our health, each and every  Hoosier should adhere to CDC guidance and take responsibility for their safety and the  health and safety of those around them.    Unless otherwise specified, nothing in this Executive Order prohibits a county or political  subdivision from imposing more stringent requirements than this Executive Order  requires.    2. Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19 within each County and Statewide    County by County Assessment: The State has implemented a color-coded system to inform  Hoosiers about the status of COVID-19 across Indiana. The color-coded system or zones  will be updated at least weekly.    Zones: There are 4 levels of the monitoring system which include:    i) Blue Zone: Continue with all current activities as outlined for Stage 5 in this  Executive Order;    ii) Yellow Zone: Community spread risk remains low but increased awareness and  safety vigilance are needed;    iii) Orange Zone: Community spread is high and the ISDH will consult with local  officials about ways to slow the disease spread; and    iv) Red Zone: The prevalence of disease activity shows very significant community  spread and the ISDH may order actions to mitigate the spread of disease.    Assessment by the State Health Commissioner:  i) County Specific Weekly Assessment: \\ direct the Commissioner of the ISDH to:  1) implement and conduct on a weekly basis, a four level, color-coded health  assessment for each county within the state based on data indicating an increase    or decrease of COVID-related activity;    2) continue communicating with local health and other officials when assessing  and assigning the appropriate level to each county;    3) continue providing guidance to local officials and consult with them regarding  issuance of additional measures to mitigate against COVID-19; and    4) in making the weekly assessment, consider the following:    a) seven (7) day all tests positivity rate (percentage of positive test results over  the number of tests performed);    b) new weekly cases per 100,000 residents;    c) whether a county’s positivity rate has increased or decreased from the  previous week; and    SFIS Ti USDA DDH USDA DCD TDP DUCD DT STI    aati ai ia    | sca TAREEERO TORE NRONOMNNONEERNRNREERTOREENNOMeOEE  \x0c     ia aaa    eee ee ee EE NE BOG ae aaa a nea    a    d) whether any increase in the percentage of positive cases is isolated to  congregate living settings or is from the community at large.    ii) Statewide: 1 direct the Commissioner of the ISDH to continue to monitor the  following factors and report any significant regional or statewide changes in:    1) the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients;  2) the capacity for critical care beds and ventilators;  3) the ability to test for COVID-19; and    4) the capacity for contact tracing.    3. Requirements for All Hoosiers in Stage 5  Unless additional restrictions are imposed under the color-coded system described above  which then must be observed, all individuals in the State of Indiana must adhere to the  following:    a. Exercise Caution at all Times: Individuals in the state are encouraged to exercise caution    and take precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.    b.

Code  ch. 10-14-3 (“Emergency Disaster Law”), I have authority to take actions necessary  to prepare for, respond to and address a public health disaster emergency including  the following:    > making, amending and rescinding the necessary orders, rules and regulations  to carry out the response to a public health disaster emergency;    > suspending the provisions of any regulatory statute prescribing the procedures  for conduct of state business, including the orders, rules or regulations of any  state agency if strict compliance with any of these provisions would in any way  prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency;    > transferring the direction, personnel, or functions of state departments and  agencies or units for performing or facilitating emergency services; and    > using any and all available resources of state government and of each political  subdivision of our State as reasonably necessary to cope with the public health  disaster emergency;    in addition to the authority granted to me by the Indiana General Assembly, the  Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) has been granted authority under  Title 16 of the Indiana Code to take measures in connection with prevention  and suppression of disease and epidemics;    to reduce and slow the spread of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) and the ISDH recommended implementation of mitigation  strategies to contain this virus including engaging in social distancing and wearing  face coverings in public settings and when around people who don’t live in the  same household;    in order to take all necessary steps to increase containment of this virus, I have  issued various Executive Orders including a stay-at-home order, closure of state  government buildings and restrictions on retail establishments and on in~person  dining at restaurants;    by consulting with experts and utilizing a data-driven approach to make decisions  based on facts, science, and recommendations from experts in health care,  business, labor, and education, we began to reopen our Hoosier economy while  prioritizing Hoosiers’ health in the process;    FR DADA IADR IR DADA IR IRDA DADA DRI DA DADA IR DR DA DADA IRR DR DR DEIR IR    FRA DADA IRDA DEIR DADA IR DAD ADE DR DR IRDA DADA DR DA DR IRDA DADA DR DADA DA    pre    oR  \x0c     Ba  5  xe  xe  xe  EG  5e  xe  56  ie  x8    Bee ee eee ee oe ee ee ee iG SOG Pi PI 2G 2G PIG BI Bo Ba Bo co oc oo Soo Do oo    a    WHEREAS,    WHEREAS,    WHEREAS,    WHEREAS,    WHEREAS,    to continue mitigation of COVID-19 and to lower the risk of a resurgence, a  measured and staggered approach to reopening businesses and entities has been  instituted. Five stages were outlined initially with each ensuing stage being subject  to fewer restrictions and limitations than the previous stage;    as key data points regarding COVID-19 improved, the Hoosier state transitioned  into Stage 5 on September 26, 2020, which is set for expiration at 11:59 p.m. on  October 17, 2020, unless modified or extended;    key data points on COVID-19 pertaining to the Hoosier state’s positivity rate, the  number of new cases per 100,000 people and hospitalizations have been  increasing in Stage 5, and thus, additional monitoring is warranted before  considering further modifications;    additionally throughout many areas across the United States, there are signs of  increased coronavirus spread and evidence of resurgence in areas where there has  been significant reopening of businesses and easing or disregard of mitigation  efforts and this also warrants additional monitoring;    based on all of the above, the State of Indiana will remain in Stage 5 for a period of  four additional weeks which will allow all businesses to remain open and  operational while continuing to require a few strategic and critical measures to  protect Hoosiers from the spread of this dangerous virus.    NOW, THEREFORE, I, Eric J. Holcomb, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor by the  Indiana Constitution and the laws of the State of Indiana, do hereby order:    1. On October 18, 2020, at 12:01 a.m. all individuals, businesses, entities and counties in  the State shall remain in Stage 5 until 11:59 p.m. Saturday, November 14, 2020, unless  extended, modified or rescinded by me.    2. All directives in Executive Order 20-43 (Stage 5) are continued and extended through  November 14, 2020.    IT IS SO ORDERED.         ATTEST:    IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I, Eric J. Holcomb,  have hereunto set my hand and caused to be  affixed the Great Seal of the State of Indiana,  on this 15 day of October, 2020.    eRe THacent    Enc].
